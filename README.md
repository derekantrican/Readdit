# Readdit

This is a simple, React-based, read-only Reddit client.

Test it out by going to [readdit.app](https://readdit.app)

*Currently, this is only built for mobile*

*(More content to come)*

## Todos

- A "settings" stored in browser storage would be handy (eg some quick selections of subreddits or multireddits - maybe even allow people to create their own sub list in the app)
- Support v.redd.it (reddit video) embeds (there's a good react example at https://github.com/junipf/reddit-frontend/tree/master/src/components/reddit-video.jsx)
